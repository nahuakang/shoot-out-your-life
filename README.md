# Shoot Out Your Life
This is a fork from [puppetmaster's game](https://github.com/puppetmaster-/shoot-out-your-life) under the [Apache-2.0 License](https://github.com/puppetmaster-/shoot-out-your-life/blob/master/LICENSE).

I created this repository to purely study his game and learn to write better Rust code and to use the 2D gaming framework [Tetra](https://tetra.seventeencups.net/) better.
